# VirusSimulationProgram
CIS Year 10 Python Interdisciplinary Project
Please import matplotlib and tkinter, e.g. using pip / Homebrew

My first Python project, focused on the simulation of a medical testing. 
Functions include changing initial + maximum virus population, clearance chance, maximum birth probability, days of simulation, and whether the patient takes medicine (named Guttagonal).
